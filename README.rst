B3LAB - OpenStack Dashboard Register Panel
==========================================
  
Horizon is the canonical implementation of OpenStack’s Dashboard, which provides a web based user interface to OpenStack services. However basically it does not have a Self Registration Panel, which does not make sense that a cloud platform needs a human interaction for registration purposes.  
  
Our forked project of Horizon at b3lab/register branch includes a self registration panel. This document describes how to install Horizon Dashboard with a registration panel.  
  
REQUIREMENTS

You need a running OpenStack (stable/mitaka) installation. You can use Devstack as you test environment.  
Be aware B3LAB/Register panel developed over Horizon stable/mitaka version and it may not work with other versions.
